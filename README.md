# nlp-sarcasm

Sarcasm is a form of irony that is often used to convey humour or to mock or criticize
something/someone. It can be difficult to detect in written conversations, especially when
the tone and facial expressions - indicators of sarcasm used in in-person conversations - are
absent. This can lead to misunderstandings and can cause confusion or can be offensive to 
someone if the sarcastic comment is not recognised.

There is a need to detect sarcasm in online conversations because it can help people better
understand the intentions and meanings behind the comments they are reading, and it can also help 
prevent misunderstandings and conflicts.

Sarcasm can be difficult to understand for some neurodiversity refers to the natural variation
in the way that the brain functions and processes information. Some neurodivergent individuals may
have difficulty understanding and interpreting social cues, due to differences in the way their
processes information.

It's important to be mindful of this when communicating with neurodivergent individuals and to be
explicit about your intentions when using sarcasm or irony. It can also be helpful to provid 
additional context or to use alternative forms of communication, such as facial expressions or 
gestures, to help convey your message more clearly. It's important to create an inclusive and 
supportive environment that recognizes and values the strengths and differences of all individuals.

Hence, by using NLP, we can try to detect sarcasm by analysing the words and phrases used. Tone and
context in which they are spoken in are also used. One approach is to use supervised learning. 
Another approach is to use unsupervised learning. This approach can be more challenging, as the
model must learn to identify sarcasm without any explicit examples to learn from.

In either case, it can be helpful to use additional features such as tone of the statement, the word
choice, and the context in which the statement is made to help the model better understand the 
intended meaning of the statement.
Detecting sarcasm is a challenging task, and current approaches are not always able to accurately
identify sarcastic statements. We aim to compare a few models each from both supervised and
unsupervised learning and try to come up with a solution of predicting sarcasm with more precision
and accuracy.
